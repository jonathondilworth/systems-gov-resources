- [Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf) - "Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."
